# card-spending-limit-react-native
App demonstrates 2 mock screens with little or no logic -
1) Homepage - Where on the homepage, the userdata is fetched using a mock api.
2) SpendingLimit page - The user can navigate to the second page by clicking on weekly spending item on the home page. 

Feel free to modify and enchance the app. Logic is not implemented. 
Redux, API calling, stack navigation is used.
